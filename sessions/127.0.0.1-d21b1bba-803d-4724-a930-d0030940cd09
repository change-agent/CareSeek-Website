S"   It all started when our predictably heroic protagonist, Tone Abbet, woke up in a foxy forest. It was the third time it had happened. Feeling barely concerned, Tone Abbet stroked a live hand grenade, thinking it would make him feel better (but as usual, it did not). Heart filled with earnest fortitude, he realized that his beloved Budgy smugglers  was missing!  Immediately he called his overtly elitist, rich friend, Jolia Golord. Tone Abbet had known Jolia Golord for (plus or minus) 61 years, the majority of which were flamboyant ones.  Jolia Golord was unique. She was intelligent though sometimes a little... abrasive. Tone Abbet called her anyway, for the situation was urgent.\r\n\r\n   Jolia Golord picked up to a very unhappy Tone Abbet. Jolia Golord calmly assured him that most legless puppies shudder before mating, yet South American hissing sloths usually explosively sneeze *after* mating. She had no idea what that meant; she was only concerned with distracting Tone Abbet.  Why was Jolia Golord trying to distract Tone Abbet?  Because she had snuck out from Tone Abbet's with the Budgy smugglers  only eleven days prior.  It was a exotic little Budgy smugglers ... how could she resist?\r\n\r\n   It didn't take long before Tone Abbet got back to the subject at hand: his Budgy smugglers . Jolia Golord cringed. Relunctantly, Jolia Golord invited him over, assuring him they'd find the Budgy smugglers . Tone Abbet grabbed his giraffe and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Jolia Golord realized that she was in trouble. She had to find a place to hide the Budgy smugglers  and she had to do it randomly. She figured that if Tone Abbet took the homemade car, she had take at least nine minutes before Tone Abbet would get there.  But if he took the Budget Cuts?  Then Jolia Golord would be very screwed.\r\n\r\n   Before she could come up with any reasonable ideas, Jolia Golord was interrupted by seven oafish Immigrantss that were lured by her Budgy smugglers . Jolia Golord belched; 'Not again', she thought. Feeling displeased, she deftly reached for her live hand grenade and randomly hit every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the fanstic pumpkin patch, squealing with discontent. She exhaled with relief.  That's when she heard the Budget Cuts rolling up.  It was Tone Abbet.\r\n   Jolia Golord picked up to a very unctuous Tone Abbet. Jolia Golord calmly assured him that most albino cats sigh before mating, yet spotted wolf hamsters usually scandalously panic *after* mating. She had no idea what that meant; she was only concerned with distracting Tone Abbet.  Why was Jolia Golord trying to distract Tone Abbet?  Because she had snuck out from Tone Abbet's with the Budgy smugglers  only seven days prior.  It was a exotic little Budgy smugglers ... how could she resist?\r\n\r\n   It didn't take long before Tone Abbet got back to the subject at hand: his Budgy smugglers . Jolia Golord yawned. Relunctantly, Jolia Golord invited him over, assuring him they'd find the Budgy smugglers . Tone Abbet grabbed his whale and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Jolia Golord realized that she was in trouble. She had to find a place to hide the Budgy smugglers  and she had to do it deftly. She figured that if Tone Abbet took the pimp fresh, candy-painted 'Lac, she had take at least ten minutes before Tone Abbet would get there.  But if he took the Budget Cuts?  Then Jolia Golord would be abnormally screwed.\r\n\r\n   Before she could come up with any reasonable ideas, Jolia Golord was interrupted by six dimwitted Immigrantss that were lured by her Budgy smugglers . Jolia Golord belched; 'Not again', she thought. Feeling exasperated, she carefully reached for her gerbil and randomly backhanded every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the imaginery desert, squealing with discontent. She exhaled with relief.  That's when she heard the Budget Cuts rolling up.  It was Tone Abbet."
